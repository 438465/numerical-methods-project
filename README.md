# Numerical Methods Project (SIR Model)
We simulate viral marketing using the SIR model and solve it with Euler method.
Model:
dS/dt = -β S I
dI/dt = β S I - γ I
dR/dt = γ I

We plot S, I, R over time using Python + Matplotlib.
Where:
- β is the viral spread rate
- γ is the forgetting rate
Project status: initial model definition completed.
